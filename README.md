> This component, using d3js API, draw an animated treemap

![Version](http://img.shields.io/version/0.3.2.png?color=green)


## Features
This is a visual component that draw a chart with centered gravity based on [d3](http://d3js.org/) API library.

Based on [Jim Vallandingham Blog Post](http://vallandingham.me/bubble_charts_in_d3.html), [Obamaâ€™s 2013 Budget Proposal](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html?_r=0) and [Automobile Force](http://projects.delimited.io/experiments/force-bubbles/radial.html), Gravity Bubbles it's a component that draw a collection of bubbles, and allow the user to compare data attributes by color and size. 

The main characteristic is the "gravity" to center, and hence its name.

#### Styles
-Under construction-


## Callbacks
When the user click on rectangle, a <strong>click</strong> is fired to comunicate that values have been clicked. It can be used to do a drilldown, such as flare example, in examples folder
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Event</th>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>click</strong></td>
        <td>d</td>
        <td>Data Clicked</td>
    </tr>
</table>


## Plugin api
#### jQuery

```javascript
$(function() {
    //instantiate the plugin
    
        chart = new TreeMap({
            id: "vis",
            width: 600,
            height: 300,
            sizeById: "size",
            colorById: "perc",
            data: {
                tooltip: function (d) {
                    return "<b>Name:</b>{name}<br><b>Size:</b> {size}<br><b>Size of Total:</b> {perc}%";
                },
                label: {
                    template: "{name}\n{perc}%",
                    autofit: false
                },
                onclick: function (d, node) {
                    //you code here to clickable data

This code and all of this job is open source and don't have restrictions, as you can see in open source licence. 

All of this code I do it as hobby, for the pleasure of coding, and to give back, that open source gave me.

But If you have saved programming hours, using this code, please think of time that I have dedicated, doing this tool.
